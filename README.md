# Work Day Schedule

## Description

You are introduced to the entire page where you can enter context, save those context, and you can also clear those context. This is meant for any individual that is having a big day for work, or technically for personal projects as well. The webpage introduces itself with it's header as being a Work Day Scheduler, it being a simple calendar app while also presenting the date and the time in a 00:00 sense. Each row has it's own time frame and you will notice there being 3 colors: the dark blue are the past time frames, the light blue is the current time frame, and the dark cyan is the furutre time frame. In these 3 blue colors you can write context that would fill your own schedule, just make sure you save it by hitting the yellow button for that row and it will mention above that it has been updated. When your starting the new day, you can Clear Schedule at the bottom by hitting the button, however will be presented with a pop-up asking if you are SURE you want to clear your schedule with all context.

Probably the big challenge I had with this project is when I had to make each row represent a certain time frame, otherwise this project was quite easy compared to my last assignment (JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz). Not sure where I can put this in other different projects, but it was certainly a good experience of learning something new and relaxing for the most part. At the end, I did come across an error that related to my style.css file and I looked up this error to confirm my thoughts and I was correct: it couldn't be found, and it was a simple fix.

This project was created and recommended by my Bootcamp, and it was a fun project. I especially loved my experience of looking up color pallets inspired by Benjamin Moore, I used the 2023 best color pallete with the addition to Bell Bottom Blues (current time frame). This was my first project of having exploring my creativity as I love playing around with CSS, for this project it was just for colors as everything in position didn't need to be changed. The only plan I have for updating this project is to have a small ping for every hour, so people can follow their schedule efficiently like a phone calendar. This was recommended by my mom, and I did grab some suggestions from my sister of how everything looked and she recommended having a pop-up of being sure a user wanted to clear the schedule.
